# roam-themes

A collection of themes for Roam Research

- Most changes are just colour to make things easier on the eye
- Also did a little bit of hiding things and adding spacing

Import via `@import url('<themename>');` e.g. `@import url('https://aleenacodes.github.io/roam-themes/mermaid-dark.css');`

Things I've left alone (for now)

- The graph overview page
- Fullscreen diagrams
- Todos in the done state
- Code blocks
- Embedded content - pdfs and tweets
- Dialogs (such as the export one)
- The reactions menu
